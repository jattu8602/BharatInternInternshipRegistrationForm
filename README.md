# Registration and Login Form

This project is part of my internship at Bharat Intern, where I developed a registration and login form using the MERN stack. The project includes user authentication, error handling, and data display features.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend
- React.js: Used to create the user interface and handle the frontend logic.

### Backend
- Node.js: Server-side JavaScript runtime.
- Express.js: Web framework for Node.js.
- MongoDB: NoSQL database used for storing user data.

## Features

- User Registration: Users can register with their details, and the information is securely stored in the database.
- User Login: Registered users can log in to access personalized content.
- Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling mechanisms for form validation and server-side processing.
- User Data Display: Displays user-specific data on the dashboard after login.

## Getting Started
